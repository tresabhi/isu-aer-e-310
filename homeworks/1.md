## 1.

Given:

$$
f(x,y) = xy
$$

## 1. (a)

> Plot the level surfaces of the function

$$
f(x,y) = c = xy
$$

$$
y = \frac{c}{x}
$$

I chose all integers in $[-3, 3]$ to generate [the following Desmos level surfaces](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/yg04m60tc2):

## 1. (b)

> Find the equation for the gradient and plot the gradient vectors to show that the gradient is perpendicular to the level surfaces

$$
\nabla f(x,y) = \langle \frac{\partial}{\partial x} xy, \frac{\partial}{\partial y} xy \rangle = \langle y, x \rangle
$$

I chose an $11 \times 11$ grid of points to generate [the following Desmos gradient vectors](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/p4rdywqtus):
